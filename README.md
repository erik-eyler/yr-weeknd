### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP

#### MVP

- Use external API from Airtable
- Display various destination/activity information from Airtable on page.
- Users can create, edit, and delete new destinations
- Clean CSS styling

#### PostMVP

- Users can add their own ratings / reviews
- More CSS styling / dynamics (like Toastify)

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: React fundamentals

### Weaknesses: CSS Styling, color choices and responsive code

### Opportunities: Improve my comfort with CSS and creating layouts, learn Tailwind

### Threats: Getting off schedule and spending too much time fixing mistakes
